    "\n",
    "<p>We meaning by data pre-processing theses steps it could modify the current values or generate new values based on the existed ones.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The new [appended] generated coloumns is designed to be used many times in next steps to get rapid and accurate analysis reports.</p>\n",

    "* We might expected here to find a numeric structure discribe the experience years for a job, but it appears to be [alphanumeric] coloumn.\n",
    "\n",
    "* These un-structured values appear to hold like these pattern to describe the experience years:\n",
    ">3-2 <br/>\n",
    "above 5 years <br/>\n",
    "+3 <br/>\n",
    "less than 6 years\n",
    "..\n",
    "\n",
    "* We start by filtering the alpha characters and set some NLP rules to get meaning of these words. Then extract the values to new two columns **[experience_years_min]** for the minimum required experience years and **[experience_years_max]** for maximum required experience years. In addition to **[experience_years_type]** which describes the duration type [year or month]\n",
    "\n",
    "### post_date\n",
    "* Although [post_date] column is a structured value, but we extracted a new two columns which will be used frequantly next. **[post_data_month]** for month and **[post_data_year]** for year.\n",

    "### description | job_requirements | displayed_job_title\n",
    "..* we applied many pre-processing tasks on these rich text columns.\n",
    "1. Remove HTML Tags\n",
    "2. Normalize English case-folding [Uppercase to Lowercase]\n",
    "3. Normalize Arabic characters. for example\n",

    "### city_name\n",
    "<p> We could consider it is the **most challenging** pre-processing task for these reasons: </p>\n",
    "1. Arabic/English Mixed values <br />\n",
    "2. User could enter many countries once. For example [Cairo and Giza], [Cairo, Aswan and  Giza], [القاهرة و الاسماعيلية], ... <br />\n",
    "3. Typos or miss spelled country names. <br />\n",
    "4. The huge variance of the unique entries <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> Before the pre-processing step. the total unique values in [city_name] was: **478**</p>\n",
    "<p> We started apply some steps to minimize and normalize this variance  </p>\n",
    "1. Remove some special characters [%,^,(, ...] <br />\n",
    "2. Detect if there are many mentioned countries in the same entry <br />\n",
    "3. Prepare a list [gazetteer] of all Egypt countries which is extracted from wikipedia-[English]. And Translate some of the most famous countries into Arabic. <br />\n",
    "4. Unify all different values which could refere to the same entity. For example all of these  values [**Cairo, Cairo and , cairo, القاهرة,قاهرة**] will be [**cairo**]\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>At the end, the unique values in [city_name] is decreased to be just **251** :)</p>\n"
